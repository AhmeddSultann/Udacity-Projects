# Udacity C++ Nanodegree

Hi there.

This is a repository containing all the projects that I have worked on in my C++ Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Project 1: Path planning
* Encapsulated in the folder `CppND-Route-Planning-Project`
* In this project, an A* algorithm is utilized to implement a path planning algorithm
    * Uses *OpenStreetMap* a free geodata provider.
    * Utilizes the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path between the *start* and *end* points.
